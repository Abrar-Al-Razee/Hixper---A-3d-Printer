## **Day - 1, ( 11/11/25 ) - Planning and breakdown idea**  
I plan to build a 3d printer from scratch. I know its not that much easy but I love to Take challenges. I Planned to build a printer to make the printing smoother and good quality




## **Day - 2, ( 13/11/25 ) - Planning and breakdown idea**  

⏳ **Time Spent:** 5+ hours  

- Watched multiple YouTube videos on **how 3D printers work** and their components.  
- Read various articles to understand **FDM printing, mechanics, and common issues**.  
- Identified **filament detection** as a key problem to solve.  
- Goal: **Keep cost under $400** while ensuring quality.  
- Planned a **filament sensor** to pause printing when filament runs out.  
- Next: Research detection methods, sketch design, estimate costs.  


## **Day - 2, ( 14/11/25 ) - Findings and gather printer idea from exist one**  
⏳ **Time Spent:** 3+ hours  

Firstly I researched popular 3D printers to understand their features, components, and designs. I noted key aspects like print volume, filament types, quality, and ease of use. I organized my findings and explored technologies to make the idea happen. So lessgo on building....


## **Day - 3, ( 17/11/25 ) - Assembly frame structure**  
⏳ **Time Spent:** 4+ hours  

### Description
- Started to design the main skeleton of the printer.

### Parts Breakdown ( z-axis left & z-axis right)


## **Day - 5, ( 24/11/25 ) - Z-axis limit switch & Y-axis assembly**  
⏳ **Time Spent:** 5+ hours  


### Description
- Firstly i started to design the printer Z-axis and then 
- Design the limit switch here
- After that started to design the Y-axis


- ### Z-axis

## **Day - 7, ( 26/11/25 ) - Feed & Cooling Assembly**  
⏳ **Time Spent:** 4+ hours  

### Description
- Here i design the feed and then started to work in the main fun fact so it not miss the filament anymore
-   Added an IR sensor at the filament entry point to detect if the filament is missing.
-   If filament is missing during printing, the sensor triggers:
    -   Automatic pausing of the print
    -   An alert sound.
    -   A popup notification to your phone.
