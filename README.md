I often notice that after 3D prints finish, thin plastic threads (stringing) often appear between gaps or travel paths. This ruins surface quality and usually requires manual post-processing. So I plan to build a system to auto smooth the printing, by automatically blows  **precisely controlled hot air**  at specific positions, we can do this thing to get smooth print.

### Bom
[Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1szXZdQRvKWeNMLEV-HKFASQY0L3tVTtc/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=104339612074747512309&rtpof=true&sd=true) is the BOM for this printer

### CAD
The CAD file for the printer is available on [autodesk](https://) and [oneshape](https://)

    -   **Glass Enclosure**:
        -   As shown by your blue outline, the printer is enclosed in a  **glass case**  to:
        -   Maintain internal temperature.
        -   Prevent air disturbance.
        -   Contain hot air application safely.
    -   **Airflow System:**
        -   A series of  **airflow nozzles**  (shown in purple dots on the sides in your image) installed vertically on both sides of the printer frame.
        -   These nozzles are controlled to release  **hot air**  in short bursts on specific layers or coordinates post-print.


Now its time to **build** *it*.
